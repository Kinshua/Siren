## Overview

SIREN is an offensive security engine built around mathematical reasoning rather than large-language-model prompts. Where most tools in this space forward targets to an external API and parse whatever comes back, SIREN maintains its own probabilistic model of the target, updates beliefs as evidence arrives, and synthesizes exploit chains algorithmically.

The core is written in pure Python (stdlib only, no third-party packages) and is organized into six operational tiers — from a Bayesian inference cortex down through arsenal modules, intelligence analysis, campaign automation, compliance output, and a self-evolution layer that improves strategy selection over time.

At a glance:

| | SIREN | Typical "AI Pentest" tools |
|---|---|---|
| Reasoning | Bayesian inference, own math | LLM API calls |
| Vuln analysis | 128-dim genetic fingerprints | Signature matching |
| Exploit chains | A\* pathfinding synthesis | Manual / LLM-suggested |
| Attacker models | 8+ behavioral personas | Single generic approach |
| Defense output | WAF / IDS / SIGMA rule generation | Not available |
| Adaptation | ELO-ranked strategy evolution | Static |
| Dependencies | None (Python stdlib) | Heavy |
| Offline use | Full functionality | Requires internet |

---

## How It Works

### Bayesian Inference

SIREN keeps a belief state — a set of probability distributions over possible vulnerabilities on a given target. Each piece of gathered evidence (response headers, status codes, technology fingerprints) triggers a posterior update:

```
P(vuln | evidence) = P(evidence | vuln) * P(vuln) / P(evidence)
```

This allows the engine to estimate the likelihood of vulnerabilities it has not directly tested, based on correlations observed in the evidence so far.

### Vulnerability Genetics

Every identified vulnerability is encoded as a 128-dimensional genome vector that captures its behavioral profile. The engine compares genomes across targets through:

- **Extraction** — mapping vulnerability traits to vector components
- **Comparison** — cosine similarity between genome vectors
- **Lineage tracking** — tracing how a vulnerability evolves across software versions
- **Mutation analysis** — detecting behavioral drift between deployments
- **Prediction** — forecasting undiscovered vulnerabilities from genetic patterns

### Exploit Chain Synthesis

Individual low-severity findings are rarely interesting on their own. The synthesis module uses A\* search to combine them into multi-step attack paths:

```
Open redirect   (Low)  ─┐
SSRF, partial   (Low)   ├──▶  Chained path  (Critical — RCE)
Unrestricted upload (Low) ─┘
```

Candidates are scored by feasibility, stealth, and impact. The output is a ranked list of actionable chains.

## Architecture

SIREN is organized into six tiers, each building on the layers below it.

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tier 0 — CORTEX** contains the probabilistic reasoning core: Bayesian engine, vulnerability DNA, exploit chain synthesis via A\*, attack persona simulation, a persistent knowledge graph, multi-modal cognitive reasoner, adversarial ML detector, and attack planner.

**Tier 1 — ARSENAL** provides 13 domain-specific engines: protocol dissector, supply chain auditor, container security (Docker/K8s CIS), GraphQL, WebSocket (RFC 6455), cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), IoT (MQTT/CoAP/Modbus/BACnet/UPnP), network exploiter, DAST, SAST with taint tracking, Active Directory, firmware analyzer, and LLM security tester.

**Tier 2 — INTELLIGENCE** handles analysis and reporting: executive-oriented attack narratives, defensive mirror (auto-generates WAF rules, firewall rules, IDS signatures, SIGMA rules, code patches, config fixes for each finding), OSINT correlator, deep fingerprinting (L0–L6), CVE prediction, social engineering modules, and threat hunting with IOC/STIX/YARA output.

**Tier 3 — AUTOMATION** manages campaign orchestration, continuous monitoring with alerting, and cross-scan result correlation with deduplication.

**Tier 4 — OUTPUT** maps findings to compliance frameworks (PCI-DSS v4.0, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001, OWASP Top 10, NIST 800-53, CIS Controls v8), calculates business-context risk scores, and generates framework-specific remediation plans.

**Tier 5 — META** drives self-improvement: pattern learning across scans, a strategy bank with similarity search, ELO-based technique ranking, genetic payload mutation, and a performance profiler that identifies bottlenecks.

**Evasion layer** (cross-cutting): 640+ WAF bypass rules with fingerprinting, IDS evasion via packet fragmentation and timing manipulation, and multi-language payload obfuscation (JavaScript, SQL, shell, HTML, PowerShell).

## Installation

Requirements: Python 3.9 or later. No additional packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kinshua/Siren.git
cd Siren
python siren.py --help
```

---

## Usage

Launch SIREN against a target:

```bash
python siren.py example.com
python siren.py https://api.example.com
```

The interactive menu groups operations into seven compact options:

```
PIPELINE
  [A] ALL                  Full pipeline (Recon > Scan > Attack > Intel)
  [1] Full Pentest         Complete 5-phase pipeline, 13 agents

RECON
  [2] Recon + OSINT        Subdomain enum, port scan, tech fingerprint, OSINT

SCAN
  [3] Vuln Scan + DAST     Web vulnerability scanner and dynamic analysis
  [4] API + Crypto Audit   OWASP API Top 10, JWT/TLS/cipher review

ATTACK
  [5] Attack Suite         Auth testing, smart fuzzing, exploit chain synthesis

INTEL
  [6] Intel + Defense      Cognitive reasoning, narrative report, defense rules

EVASION
  [7] Evasion Test         WAF bypass, IDS evasion, payload obfuscation

  [0] Exit
```

Selecting `[A]` runs all modules sequentially. Results are written as structured JSON to `./siren-output/<target>_<timestamp>/`.

MITRE ATT&CK: 14 of 14 tactics covered.

## Design Principles

1. **No external dependencies.** The entire engine runs on the Python standard library. No `pip install`, no version conflicts, no supply-chain risk. It will run on a Raspberry Pi in an air-gapped lab.

2. **Mathematical reasoning over generative guessing.** Decisions are driven by Bayesian posteriors and algorithmic search, not stochastic text generation. Every finding includes a confidence score derived from the evidence chain.

3. **Continuous self-improvement.** The meta layer records outcomes, ranks techniques by ELO, selects strategies via multi-armed bandit algorithms, and mutates payloads genetically. Each engagement makes the next one sharper.

4. **Offense produces defense.** For every vulnerability discovered, the intelligence tier generates six layers of countermeasures — WAF rules, firewall rules, IDS signatures, SIGMA detection rules, code-level patches, and configuration fixes — so the same report serves both red and blue teams.

5. **Thread safety throughout.** All engine classes use `threading.RLock` internally, making them safe for concurrent use in campaign automation and parallel scanning.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. The codebase follows a few strict rules:

- **Zero external imports.** Only the Python 3.9+ standard library.
- **Thread safety.** Every engine class must use `threading.RLock`.
- **Data structures.** Use `@dataclass` with a `.to_dict()` method.
- **Naming.** Public engine classes follow the `Siren{Name}` convention.
- **Logging.** Use `logging.getLogger("siren.<tier>.<module>")`.
